TO DO:
- get functions from main project: path functions 
- sort out text cleaning for pdfs with chapters + first letters in capitals... it seems to think there are spaces between words like MR and CORALINE






= get to grips better with the actual metrics i'm using - max, median, mean, depth skew etc
= significance of distance in network graph?




= unify approach to window analysis - rather than analysing windows, analysing individual sentences, then calculating the mean of this
= go over each module/section - make sure everything is good



- home
= how to integrate sliding window with token limit of llm? I could do the same window for each? 
= coincide window analysis with LLM token budgets
= make sure windows in the text analytics interface properly with the sliding window stuff - ie make sure the log probs, avg word frequency etc interface properly with the metrics from individual sentences in the lexico_semantics module
